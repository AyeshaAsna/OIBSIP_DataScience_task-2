OIBSIP Internship – Data Science Task 2:Unemployment Analysis with Python
# OIBSIP Data Science Task 2: Unemployment Analysis in India

## Objective
This task is part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP).  
The goal of Task 2 is to Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people
who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. We have seen a sharp
increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate
can be a good data science project.

## Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading** – Loaded unemployment dataset from CSV file.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, duplicates, and converted date formats.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Generated descriptive statistics and exploratory visualizations.
4. **Trend Analysis** – Studied unemployment patterns over years, months, regions, and urban vs rural areas.
5. **Statistical Analysis** – Performed correlation and ANOVA tests to validate patterns.
6. **Insights & Recommendations** – Summarized findings with actionable insights.

## Tools Used
- Python 3.11.9  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy  
- Dataset: *Unemployment in India* (CSV file)  
- Editor: VS Code / Jupyter Notebook  

## Outcome
- Developed a complete unemployment analysis pipeline.  
- Identified trends across years, regions, and urban vs rural areas.  
- Generated clear visualizations and insights.  
- Highlighted regions and conditions with higher unemployment for targeted policy-making.

## Key Visualizations
- Distribution of unemployment rate, employed, and labour participation.  
- Average unemployment by **region** and **area (urban vs rural)**.  
- **Time-series analysis** of unemployment rates.  
- **Correlation heatmap** of numerical indicators.  
- **Box plots & scatter plots** for comparative analysis.  

## How to Run
1. Run the script:
```bash
python task_2.py
